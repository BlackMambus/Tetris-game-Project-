# Tetris-game-Project-

Tetris is a legendary video game that combines geometric shapes, fast reflexes, and strategic thinking into a beautifully addictive challenge. Originally designed in 1984 by Alexey Pajitnov in the Soviet Union, its simple concept has captivated players for decades across countless platforms.

ðŸŽ® How It Works
Seven different shapes (called Tetrominoes) fall one at a time into a vertical playing field.

Your goal is to rotate and position each piece so it fits neatly with others.

When a full horizontal line is formed, it disappears, earning you points and freeing up space.

As you progress, the pieces fall faster, testing your speed, coordination, and planning under pressure.
